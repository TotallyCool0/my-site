## Hello there!

I hope your day is going well. Today, I slept in super late. Like, dangerously late. 😬 Oh well. 😂 I
have been spending a lot of time with family and running all over the place, so I'm super tired. My muscles
are really sore too. All that led to me sleeping like I was in a coma for several hours last night. I woke
up really disortiented. However, I feel pretty great today! 😁 It's 3:37 p.m. rn and I'm getting ready to
head into town to do a bit of work for a friend before heading to the town hall too see State Representative
Brad Fritts and State Senator Li Arellano Jr give a legislative session recap. So that's fairly exciting.
It will be interesting to get to see the people who represent me and the work that has been done since
the election. That's enough about me though, have a blessed day!
